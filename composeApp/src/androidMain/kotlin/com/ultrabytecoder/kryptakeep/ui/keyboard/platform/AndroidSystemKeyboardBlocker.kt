 * Dismisses any currently-showing system soft keyboard for the current activity.
 *
 * This is a one-shot, non-persistent dismiss: it does NOT set a window soft-input
 * mode flag, so it never blocks the system IME on non-secure fields elsewhere in
 * the app (search, send address, node URL, …). It is scoped to secure screens —
 * invoked from [AppKeyboard] only while the on-screen keyboard is showing. The
 * secure fields themselves are focusable(false) and the custom keyboard is
 * touch-driven, so the system IME cannot observe secure input regardless; this is
 * defense-in-depth against a lingering keyboard from a previous screen.
