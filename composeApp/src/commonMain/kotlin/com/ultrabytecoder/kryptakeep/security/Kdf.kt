 * Key-derivation function for the PIN/password -> KEK step (Argon2id).

 * - iOS: Argon2id via libsodium (`argon2id_hash_raw`).
 *
 * All platforms produce byte-identical output for the same
 * (password, salt, timeCost, memoryKib, parallelism) — both backends implement
 * RFC 9106 Argon2id v1.3.
 *

 * itself ([com.ultrabytecoder.kryptakeep.security.KeyManager] dispatches on it),
 * so the platform capability and the stored parameters never have to match
 * across a re-wrap.
