 *  - On failure, [unlock] leaves the array untouched — the caller owns it and must wipe it.
 *
 * Idle timeout (F-5): after [IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS] without [registerActivity] the session
 * locks itself. [appScope] must outlive the session (application scope).
 *
 * Concurrency: [stateLock] (a coroutine [Mutex]) serializes ALL state mutations —
 * both [unlock]/[unlockRecreating] and [lock]. A single lock is used so that
 * [lock] cannot interleave with [unlock]: with two independent locks, a [lock]
 * running while [unlock] was inside the driver open could either leave the
 * session unlocked after a lock was requested, or close the freshly-opened driver
 * and wipe the DEK that [unlock] had just handed to the caller.
 *
 * The lock is held only for the short state-check and state-commit phases. The
 * suspending [databaseDriverFactory.createDriver] call runs OUTSIDE the lock.
 * While the lock is released during the driver open, [lock] cannot run (it
 * suspends on the same mutex), so the race is still prevented: the commit phase
 * re-acquires the lock and re-checks [lockRequested] before publishing state.
