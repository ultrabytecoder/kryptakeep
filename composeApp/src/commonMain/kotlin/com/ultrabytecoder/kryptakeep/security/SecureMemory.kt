 * compilers can do the same for `memset`. Platform actuals use
 * compiler-resistant zeroization:
 * - Android/JVM: a volatile publication barrier that makes the zeroed contents
 *   observable to other threads, so the JIT cannot eliminate the fill.
 * - iOS: `memset_s` (C11), which cannot be elided.

 * forces us to materialize): the copies are already unreachable, this simply
 * asks the collector to reclaim them sooner.
 *
 * - Android/JVM: `System.gc()` (a hint; ART may ignore it).
 * - iOS: `kotlin.native.runtime.GC.collect()` (forces a collection pass).
 *
 * SECURITY NOTE: [gcHint] is NOT a security control. It cannot guarantee
 * that immutable Strings or other unreachable secret material is reclaimed
 * before a memory-dump attacker reads it. The only reliable mitigation is
 * to avoid materializing secrets as immutable types.
