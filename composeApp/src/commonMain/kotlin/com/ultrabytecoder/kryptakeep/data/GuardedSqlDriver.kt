/**
 * Wraps the session's [SqlDriver] so every statement execution is bracketed by
 * SessionManager's in-flight query guard. The session-lock drain waits for the
 * guard to reach zero before closing the SQLCipher driver, which makes it safe
 * for background coroutines (sync workers, reactive flow re-executions) to keep
 * using a captured database reference across a lock request: their statements
 * either finish before the close, or fail fast after it — never mid-flight on a
 * freed native handle.
 *
 * Fail-fast gate: [markClosed] is invoked by SessionManager on this exact
 * wrapper before the delegate is closed. A statement that starts AFTER the
 * close (a background coroutine still holding a captured database reference)
 * sees [closed] and throws [IllegalStateException] instead of executing on a
 * freed native handle. The check is taken around the in-flight increment:
 * an increment that lands after the close is immediately rolled back, so the
 * drain can still observe zero.
 *
 * Statement-level guarding is the contract: a lock that lands BETWEEN
 * statements of an open transaction closes the driver mid-transaction, which
 * is safe — SQLite rolls back the open transaction on close, and the
 * transaction's remaining statements then fail with the closed-driver error.
