/**
 * JNA bindings for the `g_hash_table` and error-handling subset of
 * `libglib-2.0.so` needed by the libsecret backend.
 *
 * `g_str_hash` and `g_str_equal` are fetched as raw function pointers via
 * [com.sun.jna.Function.getFunction] and passed to [g_hash_table_new_full]
 * (they are not called through this interface).
 *
 * [g_malloc0] is used instead of [com.sun.jna.Memory] for all native
 * allocations that are later freed with [g_free].  A [com.sun.jna.Memory]
 * object registers a JNA `Cleaner` that calls `free(peer)` on GC; calling
 * `g_free` on the same pointer produces a double-free that glibc detects at
 * process exit (tcache abort, exit code 134).  Pointers returned by JNA for
 * `void *` return types are plain [Pointer] instances with **no** cleaner,
 * so [g_free] is the sole deallocator.
